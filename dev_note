- Square and Regtangle grids are saved separately
- in the saved file there is no data label for each parameter, so those two file has difference sequences. In GRIDFILE_NM, there is uint8_t configured_grid_y_size saved after the x_size, where in GRIDFILE, there is no y_size.
- float x_start, y_start are saved too from this commit.
- 

Limitation
- cannot save/load grid if grid_sizes differ from the config. fix1 overide grid_size in config, fix2 save grid_size in the file.

To do
- can save grid even size is different by save/load grid size and have higher priority than default.
- square and reg saved in same file by save with same sequence
- save/load parameters sequence should be same for all, so that can save all kind of stategies. No need to check.
